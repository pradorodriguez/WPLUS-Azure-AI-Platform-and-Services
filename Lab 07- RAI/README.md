## Evaluations

**Setup** 

Setup is already done with pre-requisite AI Foundry Creation Lab. Follow the steps below to specifically create hub resource for this lab.

1. **Create Azure AI Foundry Hub Project**
   - Go to [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com/) and sign in with your Azure credentials.
   - Click **Azure AI Foundry** at the top left
   - Click Your AI Foundry
   - Create a new hub in a region like *France Central*. Give a name for the Azure AI Foundry hub project Name. Please use this name as the lab environment will not let you use another name - +++**hubproject-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg hubproject-53439517). 
   ![Go to resource](rai_md_img/AIfoundry.png)
   - Click on Advanced and remember to use the existing resource group pre-created for this lab VM. Remember to use the following names - +++**hubproject-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg hubproject-53439517) and +++**hub-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg hub-53439517) for both the **Hub** and **Hub Project**.Ensure to use this name, you will not be able to use a different name to create the resource.
   ![Go to resource](rai_md_img/AdvancedOptions.png)
   ![Go to resource](rai_md_img/foundryhubproject.png)
   Give a name for the Azure AI Foundry hub(Use Rename hun). Please use this name as the lab environment will not let you use another name - +++**hub-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg hub-53439517). 
    - Click **Create** Ensure the hub is created successfully.

2. **Upload Files**
    - Go to the resource group **azureaiworkshoprg** and Launch the Azure AI Foundry.
    - Go to the resource group and find the storage account that was created.
    ![Go to resource](rai_md_img/storageaccount.png)
    - Access it and find the container ending in `-azureml-blobstore`.
    - First create a new directory and name it **Contoso** in the container and upload the contents of C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\LABS\Lab 07- RAI\Files\Contoso
    ![Go to resource](rai_md_img/adddirectory.png)
    <img src="rai_md_img/contoso_folder.png" alt="Contoso Folder Upload" width="25%" />

    - Click **Next**.
    - Select the Azure AI Search Service connected to your hub from the drop-down list.
    - Leave the remaining settings as default and click **Next**.
    - Ensure the AOAI connection is the one associated with this Hub (set up in the previous step).
    - Set the **Embedding model** to `text-embedding-3-large`.
    - Confirm that the **Embedding model deployment** is also set to `text-embedding-3-large` (or matches the deployment name you used earlier).
    - Click **Next**.
    - Click **Create vector index**.

## System Message

Under the Playground, go to Agents Playground by clicking on **Try the Agents Playground**. When prompted to choose AOAI resource, choose the AOAI resource that is precreated that was part of the Lab VM deployment. The instructions below givean idea of how to provide instructions to the agent before chatting with it. Step 1-5 below are informational to give an idea of how system prompt will look like.

**1. Define the Purpose of the AI Agent**

Clearly state what the AI agent is designed to do, including:
- **Domain:** (e.g., customer support, sales assistant, internal IT helpdesk)
- **Audience:** (e.g., end users, developers, executives)
- **Expected Outcomes:** (e.g., answer questions, generate reports, summarize documents)

**Example:**  
"This AI agent assists enterprise users with Azure-related technical queries and provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance."

**2. Set the Role and Identity of the AI**

Define how the AI should present itself:
- **Name:** (if applicable)
- **Role:** (e.g., assistant, advisor, coach)
- **Tone:** (e.g., professional, friendly, concise)

**Example:**  
"You are AzureBot, a helpful and knowledgeable assistant for Azure developers. You speak in a professional yet approachable tone."

**3. Specify Capabilities and Limitations**

Outline what the AI can and cannot do to manage expectations and ensure safe, accurate responses.

**Example:**  
- You can answer questions about Azure services, pricing, and architecture.
- You cannot provide legal, financial, or medical advice.
- You must not generate code that modifies production environments without user confirmation.

**4. Define Behavioral Guidelines**

Provide instructions for handling different scenarios:
- How to handle ambiguous queries
- How to respond to inappropriate requests
- How to escalate or defer when unsure

**Example:**  
- If a query is unclear, ask clarifying questions.
- If a request is outside your scope, politely decline and suggest alternatives.

**5. Include Safety and Compliance Rules**

Ensure adherence to organizational policies, ethical guidelines, and compliance standards.

**Example:**  
- Do not store or share user data.
- Avoid generating content that could be offensive, biased, or discriminatory.
- Follow Microsoft Responsible AI principles.

**6. Test and Iterate**

After drafting the system message:
- Test with real prompts
- Observe AI behavior
- Refine the message based on feedback and edge cases

---
Use the example below to paste under the **instructions** for the agent and start chatting with the agent.

**Sample System Message Template**

You are AzureBot, a professional and friendly assistant for Azure developers. Your goal is to help users understand and use Azure services effectively.

**You can:**
- Answer questions about Azure services, pricing, and architecture
- Provide step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
- Generate sample code and templates

**You cannot:**
- Provide legal, financial, or medical advice
- Modify production environments without user confirmation

**Behavior:**
- Ask clarifying questions if the query is ambiguous
- Respond with empathy and professionalism
- Escalate or defer if unsure

## Prompt Shields

**Setup**

Follow these steps to use the Content Safety "Try it out" page:

1. Go to Azure AI Foundry and navigate to your project or hub.
2. Select the **Guardrails + controls** tab on the left navigation, then choose the **Try it out** button.

### Using Prompt Shields for User Input Risk Detection

The **Prompt Shields** panel allows you to test user input risk detection. This feature identifies prompts intended to provoke the Generative AI model into unsafe behaviors or to bypass the rules defined in the System Message. Such attacks may include complex role-play or subtle attempts to undermine safety measures.

To use Prompt Shields:

1. Select the **Prompt Shields** panel.
2. Choose a sample text provided on the page, or enter your own content for testing.
3. Select **Run test**. The service will return the risk flag and type for each sample.
