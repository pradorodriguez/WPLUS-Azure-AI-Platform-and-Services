# Create Azure AI Foundry Project

## Introduction 

This lab walks you through the steps to create a **Azure AI Foundry** resource using the **Azure Portal**. This is a required setup step before proceeding with lab exercises involving AI Foundry capabilities.

### 💡 What is Azure AI Foundry
Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for building, deploying, and managing enterprise-grade AI applications and agents—combining powerful tools, models, and infrastructure with built-in governance and scalability.

## Objectives 
In this lab we will:
- Create Azure AI Foundry Resource and project	


## Estimated Time 

2- 10 minutes 

## Scenario
You are creating Azure AI Foundry project that will be utilized later in the labs for several modules in this workshop.

## Pre-requisites
No pre-requisites

## 🛠️ Tasks
