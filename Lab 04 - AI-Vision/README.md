## Exercise 1: Provision Azure Resources
1. Access the Azure portal(portal.azure.com) and create a Computer Vision resource. ![Alt text](./Images/create_resource.png).
Give a name for the Computer Vision resource. Please use this name as the lab environment will not let you use another name - +++**cv-@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++ (eg cv-53439517).
2. Ensure the resource is created in a supported region. ![Alt text](./Images/create_resource_2.png)
3. Access Vision Studio at [https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/) and select your resource. ![Alt text](./Images/select_resource.png)

## Exercise 2: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
1. Go to [Azure AI Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/) - https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com, log in, and select the "Optical character recognition" tab.  ![Alt text](./Images/OCR.png)
2. Click "Extract text from images."  ![Alt text](./Images/extract_text_from_images.png)
3. Browse for a file and select your AI vision resource. ![Alt text](./Images/select_resource_azureResource.png)
4. Review results on the “Detected attributes/JSON” tabs. ![Alt text](./Images/DetectedAttributes.png)

## Exercise 3: Face Analysis
This exercise demonstrates how to use Azure AI Vision, Face to detect and analyse human faces in images. Navigate to [Azure AI | Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/), log in with your Azure 
credentials, and then click on the "Face" tab. Note that you may need to create a resource to access

## Exercise 4: Image Analysis
This exercise demonstrates how to use Azure AI Vision, Image Analysis to extract meaningful insights from images, including object detection, caption generation, and scene understanding. 
Navigate to [Azure AI | Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/), log in with your Azure credentials
1. In Vision Studio, select the "Image analysis" tab.![Alt text](./Images/imageanalysis1.png)
2. Search photos with image retrieval. ![Alt text](./Images/imageanalysis2.png)
3. Enter a natural language query to retrieve relevant images. ![Alt text](./Images/imageanalysis3.png)
4. Try generating dense captions for images.![Alt text](./Images/imageanalysis4.png)
5. Extract common tags by choosing the model, language, and clicking samples. ![Alt text](./Images/imageanalysis5.png)

<strong>Note:</strong> For the purpose of this lab, use the samples tab. Use the below instructions for use in your own subscription. We have not provided video for upload
</div>
 
1. Go to [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/account/login) and log in. ![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer1.png). Use Entra ID Authentication with the provided credentials.
2. Complete the "Use of facial identification and recognition" form and accept.![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer2.png)
3. Click "Upload," then "Browse for files" to select a video.![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer3.png)
4. Complete the upload form (file name, privacy, streaming quality, language, etc.).![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer4.png)
5. Click "Review + upload," then "Upload + index."![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer5.png)
6. Monitor progress; you'll receive an email when processing is complete. ![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer6.png). For the purpose of this lab, there won't be an email, so this step may not work for this lab environment. 
7. Click "Watch now >" in the email or view the video in the Video Indexer interface. ![Alt text](./Images/VideoIndexer7.png)
8. Review video insights: playback area, insights panel (person, topic, keywords, labels, named entities, scenes).
