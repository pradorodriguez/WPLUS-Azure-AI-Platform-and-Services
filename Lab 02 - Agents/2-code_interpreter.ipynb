    "\n",
    "You've successfully completed the **Health Calculator Agent** with **Code Interpreter** tutorial! Here's what you accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **What We Built**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🤖 Health Calculator Agent**\n",
    "- Created an AI agent with **Code Interpreter** capabilities\n",
    "- Enabled the agent to write and execute Python code in a secure sandbox\n",
    "- Configured health-focused instructions with appropriate disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📊 Key Features Demonstrated**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📁 File Upload & Management**\n",
    "   - Uploaded CSV nutrition data to the Azure AI service\n",
    "   - Learned correct file upload methods and purposes\n",
    "   - **Fixed CSV file access issues** by using message-level file attachments\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🧮 BMI Calculations**\n",
    "   - Agent performed step-by-step BMI calculations using Python code\n",
    "   - Converted between imperial and metric units\n",
    "   - Interpreted results with health categories\n",
    "   - Provided responsible AI disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **📈 Nutrition Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - Agent loaded and analyzed CSV data programmatically\n",
    "   - Computed statistical averages for macronutrients\n",
    "   - Generated data visualizations and trend analysis\n",
    "   - Provided insights with appropriate health disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🔧 Resource Management**\n",
    "   - Properly cleaned up agents, files, and local resources\n",
    "   - Demonstrated best practices for resource lifecycle management\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ **Important Fix: CSV File Access Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Problem**\n",
    "Initially, the agent couldn't access the uploaded CSV file, resulting in the error: *\"It seems there was an issue locating the file.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Root Cause**\n",
    "The issue was with how files were attached to the agent. Using `tool_resources` in the agent creation was causing SDK compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Solution**\n",
    "Instead of attaching files at the agent level, we attach them at the **message level**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This caused issues:\n",
    "# tool_resources={\"code_interpreter\": {\"file_ids\": [uploaded_file.id]}}\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ This works:\n",
    "message = project_client.agents.messages.create(\n",
    "    thread_id=thread.id,\n",
    "    role=\"user\", \n",
    "    content=user_text,\n",
    "    attachments=[{\n",
    "        \"file_id\": uploaded_file.id,\n",
    "        \"tools\": [{\"type\": \"code_interpreter\"}]\n",
    "    }]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Lessons**\n",
    "- **Message-level attachments** are more reliable than agent-level tool_resources\n",
    "- Always test file access in agents before proceeding with analysis\n",
    "- The Azure AI SDK is evolving - message-level attachments are the current best practice\n",

    "## 💡 **Best Practices Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Attachment Strategy** - Use message-level file attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources for better compatibility\n",
    "2. **Data Handling** - Validate inputs, handle missing values, manage file attachments properly\n",
    "3. **Health Disclaimers** - Always remind users you're not a medical professional\n",
    "4. **Resource Management** - Clean up agents and files to avoid unnecessary costs\n",
    "5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling for file operations and API calls\n",
    "6. **Testing** - Always test file access before proceeding with analysis\n",
    "7. **Security** - Use code interpreter for trusted operations only\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If agents can't access uploaded files:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Use message-level attachments instead of agent-level tool_resources  \n",
    "2. ✅ Verify the file was uploaded successfully (check file ID)\n",
    "3. ✅ Ensure the correct file purpose (\"assistants\") is used\n",
    "4. ✅ Include file attachments in individual messages, not globally\n",
