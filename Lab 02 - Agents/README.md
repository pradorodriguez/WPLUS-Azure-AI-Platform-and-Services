# Azure AI Agents Tutorial Collection

## Introduction 

This lab provides a comprehensive hands-on introduction to Azure AI Agents using Azure AI Foundry SDKs. You'll learn how to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents that can perform various tasks from basic conversations to complex multi-agent orchestration systems with health and fitness themed examples.

## Objectives 
In this lab we will:
- Initialize Azure AI projects and create specialized health and fitness advisor agents
- Implement agents with computational capabilities using code interpreter tools
- Enable document search and knowledge retrieval through file search
- Connect agents to real-time web information using Bing Search integration
- Integrate agents with enterprise search using Azure AI Search

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file with your Azure credentials:
   ```bash
   AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your-project-connection-string-from-azure-ml-workspace>
   MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-model-deployment-name>
   EMBEDDING_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-embedding-model-deployment-name>
   TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id-from-azure-portal>
   GROUNDING_WITH_BING_CONNECTION_NAME=<your-bing-search-connection-name>
   AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=<your-azure-ai-search-endpoint>
   AZURE_AI_SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-azure-ai-search-api-key>
   ```

## �🛡️ Important Notes

- **Resource Management**: Remember to clean up Azure resources after tutorials to avoid unnecessary charges
- **Environment Security**: Never commit your `.env` file with actual credentials to version control
- **Progressive Learning**: Complete exercises in order as they build upon previous concepts
- **Health Disclaimers**: All health and fitness examples are for educational purposes only
