    "### **Steps to Create the Connection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Azure AI Foundry portal**: https://ai.azure.com/\n",
    "2. **Go to your project** → **Settings** → **Connections**\n",
    "3. **Click \"New Connection\"** → **Azure AI Search**\n",
    "4. **Provide the following details:**\n",
    "   - **Connection Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., \"my-ai-search\")\n",
    "   - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription\n",
    "   - **Resource Group**: Choose your resource group\n",
    "   - **Azure AI Search Resource**: Select your existing search service or create a new one\n",
    "5. **Click \"Add Connection\"** to complete the setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alternative: Use Azure CLI**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create AI Search connection via CLI\n",
    "az ml connection create --file connection.yaml --resource-group <your-rg> --workspace-name <your-project>\n",
