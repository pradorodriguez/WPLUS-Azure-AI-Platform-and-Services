    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** a project using Azure AI Foundry.\n",
    "2. **Create an Agent** with the **BingGroundingTool** for web search.\n",
    "3. **Ask real-world questions** about health and fitness.\n",
    "4. **Retrieve and display** answers, including Bing query URLs and disclaimers.\n",

    "1. **Accuracy** – Bing search results may include disclaimers or partial info. Encourage verification with credible sources.\n",

    "3. **Limits** – Keep an eye on usage, rate limits, or policy constraints for Bing.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ **Critical Fixes Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Environment Variable Correction**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong environment variable name:\n",
    "bing_conn_name = os.environ.get(\"BING_CONNECTION_NAME\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct environment variable name:\n",
    "bing_conn_name = os.environ.get(\"GROUNDING_WITH_BING_CONNECTION_NAME\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Connection API Fix**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ Wrong API parameter:\n",
    "bing_connection = project_client.connections.get(connection_name=bing_conn_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct API parameter:\n",
    "bing_connection = project_client.connections.get(name=bing_conn_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Bing Tool Configuration Fix**\n",
    "The critical fix was the `search_configurations` array format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ This caused \"must be an array with exactly 1 elements\" error:\n",
    "bing_tool_def = {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"bing_grounding\",\n",
    "    \"bing_grounding\": {\n",
    "        \"connection_id\": conn_id\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# ✅ Correct format with search_configurations array:\n",
    "bing_tool_def = {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"bing_grounding\", \n",
    "    \"bing_grounding\": {\n",
    "        \"search_configurations\": [{\n",
    "            \"connection_id\": conn_id\n",
    "        }]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Enhanced Error Handling**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ✅ Added connection debugging:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    connections = project_client.connections.list()\n",
    "    print(\"Available connections:\")\n",
    "    for conn in connections:\n",
    "        print(f\"  - {conn.name} (ID: {conn.id})\")\n",
    "except Exception as list_error:\n",
    "    print(f\"  Could not list connections: {list_error}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
